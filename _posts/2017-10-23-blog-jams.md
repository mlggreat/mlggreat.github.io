BlocJams is a project that I have been working on for a few months now, and have developed this program using different computer languages.  I first developed it using HTML & CSS.  This took about a week, maybe two.  Then I moved on to recreate the same program using DOM Scripting, which is essentially HTML & CSS + JavaScript.  This was the first time I had been using DOM scripting, but I definitely found it to be the most useful between the two.  

Then to wrap it all up I took on the challenge of making it using JQuery.  Considering I had never used JQuery before this was much more of a challenge for me but definitely worth the challenge.
