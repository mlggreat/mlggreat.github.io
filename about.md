My name is Alexander Weitzner and I am currently a Video Game Design and Development Major at Quinnipiac University.  I am 23 years old from Summit, NJ.  I have been programming for almost five years now and have joined Bloc to try and improve my coding abilities as well as learn new languages and new things that I can be doing with code.  So far I have worked on several projects using multiple different computer languages.

At the same time I am working on my own side project with a software company that I started, Maga Software Technologies LLC.  I have developed a simulation to train students and faculty how to respond in active shooter situations on college campuses.  I currently have a working beta and will working on finishing that up this year.

I am also taking multiple Game Design classes in college right now and have been making some really interesting games!
